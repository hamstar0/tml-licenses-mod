Plan 1 (old)
-	Players need licenses to use items
-	Licenses bought from a Wayfarer NPC with PP (progress points)
-	Player combines item with license of its matching rarity to license it (assigned license)
-	Licenses can upgrade in rarity by combining 2 of a given rarity
-	Licenses are consumed on use, giving permanent, intrinsic item permissions
Plan 1.1 (needs entity classes mod)
-	Licenses are not consumed, but added to a license board
-	License boards store licenses on a grid as a contiguous area
-	Licenses can only be added next to licenses of similar item types
-	A starter license exists on the board that is 'similar' to any item type
-	Licenses of a given tier/rarity must exist next at least 2 of previous tier
-	Item similarity defined by damage class (not type) or composition (alleged base material)
